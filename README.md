I'm Andrew.

I studied MERN Stack through FreeCodeCamp.

I'm trying to get started professionally in Frontend Development or something similar.

Currently, I am building projects to demonstrate my skill level and hopefully interest an employer in hiring me.

I intend to also learn Unit Testing, Typescript, and contribute to open source projects while building my own projects.

You can reach me at webdevandy32@gmail.com.
